	abstract = {The thermal degradation mechanisms of poly[2,2′-bis(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenylpropane-2-phenylenediimide] (PEI) have been investigated by thermogravimetry (TG) and by direct pyrolysis mass spectrometry (DPMS). TG data show that PEI has a main decomposition step centred at about 510°C followed by a less marked step in the 600-650°C temperature range and leaving about 60{\%} of charred residue at 800°C. The total ion curve (TIC) of a purified PEI sample, obtained by DPMS, closely reproduces the two maxima appearing in the deriv ative TG (DTG) curve, whereas the TIC curve of a crude PEI sample shows two less pronounced maxima in the temperature range of 250-450°C due to low molar mass compounds, which volatilize undecomposed in the high vacuum of the MS. The structure of the pyrolysis compounds obtained in the first thermal degradation step of a purified PEI sample suggest that they are mainly formed by the scission of: i) the isopropylidene bridge of bisphenol A; ii) the oxygen-phthalimide bond; iii) the phenyl-phthalimide bond, which are apparently the weakest bonds of PEI. Extensive hydrogen transfer reactions and subsequent condensation reactions may account for the high amount of char residue. The pyrolysis compounds obtained in the second degradation step (620°C) are mainly constituted of CO 2 , benzene, aniline, benzonintrile, phenylenediamine, and dibenzonitrile, which may be generated by further thermal degradation reactions of pyrolysis compounds containing N - H phthalimide as end groups. Another degradation processes which may account for CO 2  formation is the hydrolysis of the imide moiety to form poly(amic acid) units which produce an aromatic amide structure by decarboxylation. The pyrolysis of an aromatic polyamide (NOMEX) was then studied for comparison. The structure of the pyrolysis products detected by the DPMS analysis of both polymers allowed a detailed schematization of the thermal degradation pathways involved in the degradation of PEI and on the reactions leading to the formation of the charred residue. {\textcopyright} WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim 1999.},

Existing analyses of single idealized contacts are summarized and compared, and then applied, together with results of recent electrolytic analog tests, to predict the conductance of multiple contacts. "appropriately" or "inappropriately" distributed at the interface. Reconsideration of the theory of interaction between randomly rough surfaces shows how the parameters required to predict heat transfer can be determined in principle by simple manipulation of typical profiles of the mating surface, together with an approximation from deformation theory. It is also shown that this process depends more crucially than had been realized upon the distribution of the few high peaks of the surfaces, where the assumption of Gaussian distribution of heights is suspect. In place of that assumption, the use of describing functions is suggested. The few experimental data relevant to these theories are examined and compared with predictions of theory. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

Shorter tracer chains exhibit a greater slowing down than longer chains, whereas longer matrix chains decrease the value of $\phi$crit. The experimental results are discussed in terms of locally anisotropic diffusion perpendicular andparallel to the nanotube filler andsimulated using a trap model that defines a trap size and the extent of slowing perpendicular to the cylindrical trap. The simulated diffusion coefficients capture both the initial decrease in D attributed to isolated traps and the recovery of D above $\phi$crit corresponding to trap percolation.

@article{Kabanemi2010,
	abstract = {A reptation-based model, that incorporates transient polymer-nanoparticle surface interactions, is proposed to describe the dynamics and rheological behaviors of linear entangled polymers filled with isotropic rigid nanoscale particles. Dispersed nanoparticles are sufficiently small such that even at low volume fractions, the average particle wall-to-wall distance is on the order of the chain size. The model predicts a scaling law in the form, $\tau$d,eff∼$\tau$d($\phi$adN+1)2, where $\tau$d,eff is the effective reptation time of a chain in the presence of attractive nanoparticles, $\tau$d is its reptation time in the neat polymer, $\phi$ad is the fraction of attached monomers per chain, and N is the number of monomers per chain. Hence, the overall relaxation is extremely retarded by attractive nanoparticles in the limit of strongly adsorbed chains. Also, it is found that the effective reptation time, $\tau$d,eff, can be controlled through five main parameters, i.e., the molecular weight of the polymer chain, N, the size of the nanoparticles, df, the density of attractive site on the nanoparticle surface, nas, the monomer-nanoparticle energetic interaction, e{\{}open{\}}, and the nanoparticle volume fraction, $\phi$f. The nonequilibrium dynamics of detachment/re-attachment of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces under flow conditions is incorporated in the model to elucidate the effect of monomer-surface interactions on the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. The resulting model correctly captures the linear dynamical properties and shear rheological behaviors of nanocomposite systems studied. Under very slow shear flow conditions, these filled systems exhibit a strong non-Newtonian behavior and a large enhancement in the viscosity as a certain number of monomers in the chain are attached to nanoparticle surfaces, while at very high shear rates, the neat polymer dominates the shear thinning behavior, suggesting that addition of nanoparticles contributes negligible to the viscosity in strong flows. A picture that is based on transient polymer-particle surface interactions, i.e., the detachment/re-attachment dynamics of monomers from/to nanoparticle surfaces is proposed to interpret the observed huge alteration in rheological properties. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

The specimens consisted of a flange, representing a stringer or frame, welded onto a skin laminate. The effects of the welding parameters such as the input power level and clamping distance on the weld quality and performance were investigated. The welding parameters were optimised using short beam shear tests, ultrasonic C-scan inspection and optical microscopy. The mechanical performance of the resistance-welded skin/stringer configuration was investigated using three- and four-point bending tests and the failure mechanisms were characterised by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Two methods were used to reduce the stress concentration at the flange tip. The first method was to machine a 20° taper angle at the edge of the flange and the second one was to create a resin fillet at the flange tip. No mechanical performance improvement was obtained with the resin fillet method but the taper angle method showed 25{\%} mechanical performance improvement when the taper angles were machined after the welding operation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Unidirectional (UD) and quasi-isotropic adherends were welded using stainless steel meshes as heating elements. The specimen geometry consisted of a flange laminate, representing a stringer, welded onto a skin laminate. In order to avoid current leakage to the electrically conductive adherends, a ceramic-coated heating element (TiO2 HE) was used for welding the UD specimens and some of the quasi-isotropic specimens. The fatigue performance of the welded joints was investigated under three-point bending. An indefinite fatigue life was obtained at 40{\%} and 35{\%} of the static damage initiation load for the UD and quasi-isotropic specimens, respectively. The failure mechanisms were documented based on observation of the fatigue cracks initiation and growth. UD specimens failed at the weld interface while quasi-isotropic specimens showed delaminations both in the flange or skin laminates and at the weld interface. The TiO2 HE did not show any fatigue mechanical performance reduction. However, debonding at the weld interface was shown to occur between the metal mesh wires and the TiO2 coating instead of between the laminates and the weld. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Joining composite materials is an issue because traditional joining technologies are not directly transferable to composite structures. Fusion bonding and the use of thermoplastic films as hot melt adhesives offer an alternative to mechanical fastening and thermosetting adhesive bonding. Fusion bonding technology which originated from the thermoplastic polymer industry has gain a new interest with the introduction of thermoplastic matrix composites (TPC) which are currently regarded as candidates for primary structures. The improvement of thermoplastic polymer matrices, with the introduction of recent chemistries such as PEEK, PEI and PEKEKK. exhibiting increased mechanical performance, service temperature and solvent resistance (for the semi-crystalline systems) also supported the growth of interest for fusion bonding. This review looks at the state of the art of fusion bonding technology and focuses particularly on the three most promising fusion bonding techniques: ultrasonic welding, induction welding and resistance welding. Physical mechanisms involved in the fusion bonding process for modelling purposes are discussed including heat transfer, consolidation and crystallinity aspects. Finally, the application of fusion bonding to joining dissimilar materials, namely thermosetting composites (TSC)/TPC and metal/TPC joints, is reviewed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {The process-induced voids during resistance welding of glass fabric-reinforced polyetherimide was investigated. The mechanisms of void formation in adherends, in particular, the residual volatile-induced voids and the fibre de-compaction-induced voids, were analysed. Due to the non-uniform temperature and stress distributions in the joints during welding, a non-uniform void distribution was observed in the joints with more voids generated in the middle of the joints than at the edges. Welding temperature and pressure were shown to have a large influence on void formation. Increasing of welding pressure was shown to effectively reduce the voids, while the residual moisture-induced voids were found more difficult to be eliminated than the fibre de-compaction-induced voids.},

To date, controlled dispersion of CNTs in a solution or a composite matrix remains a challenge, due to the strong van der Waals binding energies associated with the CNT aggregates. There is also insufficiently defined correlation between the microstructure and the physical properties of the composite. Here, we offer a review of the dispersion processes of pristine (non-covalently functionalized) CNTs in a solvent or a polymer solution. We summarize and adapt relevant theoretical analysis to guide the dispersion design and selection, from the processes of mixing/sonication, to the application of surfactants for stabilization, to the final testing of composite properties. The same approaches are expected to be also applicable to the fabrication of other composite materials involving homogeneously dispersed nanoparticles.},

These extensions make the models applicable to the manufacture of plates by tape laying and to filament winding of cylinders. These models were incorporated into a user friendly computer code which can be used to generate numerical results and to select the appropriate processing conditions for processing thermoplastic composite plates 1) in an autoclave, 2) in a press, or 3) by tape laying, and 4) for filament winding thermoplastic composite cylinders. {\textcopyright} 1992, Sage Publications.

@article{Schell2009,
	abstract = {A fundamental characteristic of composite materials is that the initial choice of fiber and matrix type together with the selected manufacturing process controls the properties of the final part. As the manufacturing process creates simultaneously the composite and the component, its influence on part quality must be considered. From a manufacturing point of view, considering equipment, energy costs and production rate, it is desirable to process the part at the lowest possible pressures and temperatures and with the shortest cycle times. The challenge consists of making the production process robust for economical manufacture by an improved understanding of the material/process/property relationships. This paper focuses on the computational and experimental analysis of fusion bonding in thermoplastic composites. The influence of the process parameters on the bond strength is investigated. The bond quality exhibits randomness, which may be problematic within an industrial context. Its origin has been explained through a simple probabilistic analysis. The process sequence is found to be a major source of this uncertainty, resulting in various thermal loading and bonding quality fluctuations. On this basis, three practical ways for quality improvement are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A model for the mechanics (oscillating deformation), heat transfer including viscoelastic heat generation and friction dissipation, and degree of adhesion (intimate contact and healing) is proposed for the initial transient heating phase. Numerical resolution was performed using a multi-physical finite element code. The predicted dissipated power evolution exhibits a good correlation with previous experimental measurement of delivered power, and shows that the apparatus has a global efficiency of 13{\%}. The predicted degree of adhesion also confirms the experimental observation that adhesion starts at the edge of the contact area, and progressively extends to the whole contact area. The numerical model was further used to investigate the physical mechanisms occurring during the welding process. As suggested in the literature, the first heating mechanism is confirmed to be due to interfacial friction. Bulk viscoelastic dissipation becomes predominant when the interface reaches higher temperatures. The dissipated power is suddenly increased when the whole interface reaches the glass transition temperature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Induction welding for thermoplastic composite materials uses an alternating current flowing through a coil to induce an electromagnetic field and generate eddy current inside laminate with various fiber orientations – the generated heat causes the laminate to heat up and melt the polymer. As a pressure is applied to the induction heating zones, cohesive bonding may occur during the melting of the polymer. The welding quality of the composite materials is highly influenced by the temperature varying inside the heating zones. Thus, it is beneficial for induction welding if temperature varying during heating can be acquired given a set of welding parameters, such as current, pressure, fiber orientations, etc. Conducting practical induction heating experiments for this purpose is laborious and time consuming given the large varying space of welding parameters. In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using machine learning techniques to model the relation between the welding parameters and the temperature varying inside the heating zones. We conduct two sets of induction heating experiments for laminate welding and the collected sample temperature varying data are used to train the neural networks with input of welding parameters and output of the predicted temperature varying. Testing of the models demonstrates that process modeling of induction welding with machine learning techniques is viable.},

A three-dimensional transient finite element model (FEM) featuring heat transfer, consolidation and thermal degradation was used for simulating the process. A hybrid interlayer made of a glass fibre (GF) fabric essentially impregnated with PEI on one side and with epoxy resin on the other side was produced to provide mechanical interlocking between the thermoplastic (TP) and the thermosetting (TS) systems. The 'optimal' resistance welding time based on the maximum lap shear strength (LSS) was determined for three power levels and correlated to the time required to achieve bonding predicted by the FEM. Consolidation quality and failure mechanisms were discussed in relation with processing parameters. Experimental and simulated processing windows were constructed and correlated to each other. However, thermal degradation as predicted by the model did not correlate to a reduction in performance of the joint. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The impulse resistance welding (IRW) process is modelled using a three-dimensional transient finite element model (FEM) featuring heat transfer and consolidation. The welding of single lap joints is simulated for APC-2 laminates, with additional PEEK film inserted at the welding interface. The effects of the power signal on (a) temperature uniformity in the welding interface and (b) processing times are investigated. Two welding configurations are evaluated; in the first one, the heating element outside the welding stack is left in-air, while in the second case, it is embedded in a conductive medium in order to improve temperature homogeneity within the welding interface. Based on criteria of consolidation and thermal degradation, optimum processing windows were simulated.},

	abstract = {An investigation was carried out into effects of graphite fiber and epoxy matrix physical properties on the temperature profile in their laminates during cure. An accurate prediction of temperature profile within composite is of paramount importance in determining the processing conditions. In this study, a valid model for temperature profile was established first. Then, three physical parameters of composites that change during cure, namely density, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity, were varied in magnitude and the ensuing effect on temperature profile examined. The range of their variation was based on the values measured in the laboratory as well as those reported in the literature. Changes in the neat resin thermal conductivity were found to significantly influence the temperature profile. 17 refs.},
